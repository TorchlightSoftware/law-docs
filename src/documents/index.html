    Law is a middleware layer for tying together:
    <ol>
      <li>A set of services</li>
      <li>Argument validations and lookups</li>
      <li>An access control policy</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Example row of columns -->
<div class="row marketing" class="text-center">
  <!-- <div class="col-lg-6"> -->
  <div class="col-md-4">
	<h2>About</h2>
Law is framework and transport agnostic.  Its focus is on enforcing the business rules specific to your application.  In our applications, we have connected these services to REST, websockets, and a programmatic API through the use of adapters.  I present below an example that should help to tie in as connect middleware.  Hopefully there will be enough information here to make this a useful tool for those interested.  If you're having trouble getting things working, let me know.
